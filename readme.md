## About

This plugin was an experiment in using Javascript to control the shortcodes order. Unlike traditional page builders, the idea was that it's use was very optional, by using it you wouldn't then be dependent on it. Being Javascript meant it was incredibility light weight. 

It was made for the TinyMCE editor and shortcodes, so doesn't work with Gutenberg.

I am considering rebuilding this for Gutenberg using some of the same concepts.
