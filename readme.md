## About

This plugin was an experiment in using Javascript to control the shortcodes order. Unlike traditional page builders, the idea was that it's use was very optional, by using it you wouldn't then be dependent on it. Being Javascript meant it was incredibility light weight.

Essentually it would turn any shortcode on the page into a drag and drop box. Clicking on the box would allow you to edit it's options. 

Now with Gutenberg things are very different so this no longer works as it was designed for the TinyMCE editor.

I have considered recreating something for Gutenberg for shortcodes but that would be a very different project. 

For now, this is depreciated.
